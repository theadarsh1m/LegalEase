              LegalEase provides general legal information, document drafting assistance, and workflow tooling. It does not create an
              advocate-client relationship and does not replace case-specific advice from a licensed lawyer.

              Users are responsible for reviewing generated drafts, validating factual accuracy, and confirming legal fit before sending
              any complaint, notice, or application to an authority, employer, landlord, court, or third party.

              High-risk matters involving custody, detention, imminent deadlines, serious financial exposure, criminal accusations, or
              personal safety should be escalated to a qualified lawyer or emergency authority promptly.
